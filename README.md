# Memory Game
The Memory Game is a web-based game designed to help players exercise their memory skills.
The game board consists of a grid of cards that are flipped over, and the player's goal is to match pairs of cards by clicking on them.
This game was created by me to refresh my skills using html, css, jquery.

## How to Play
To start the game, simply open the webpage and a welcome modal will appear. You can enter your name or leave it blank, then click the "Start" button to begin the game. The game board will then appear, consisting of a timer and a grid of cards. The timer will start counting.

To play, click on a card to flip it over and reveal the hidden symbol. Remember its location on the board. Click on another card to try to find a match. If the two cards match, they will stay open. If not, they will flip back over.

Continue playing until you have matched all the cards on the board. If you match all the cards before the timer runs out, a congratulatory modal will appear. You can click the "Play Again" button to start a new game.
